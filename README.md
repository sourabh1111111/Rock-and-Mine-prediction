# Rock-and-Mine-prediction
This project is a machine learning application that predicts whether an object is a rock or a mine based on its features.The model is trained using the Sonar dataset.
# About
I am currently learning machine learning, and this is my first project in the field. The objective is to apply what I've learned and build a predictive model from scratch.
# Features
Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load and preprocess the Sonar dataset.
Model Training: Train a Logistic Regression model to classify objects.
Prediction: Predict whether a new object is a rock or a mine.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.
